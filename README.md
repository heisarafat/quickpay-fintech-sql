# 💸 QuickPay Fintech - SQL Analytics Project

This is a simulated SQL project for a fictional fintech company called **QuickPay**, designed to demonstrate core data analysis and reportings using SQL

## 🧩 Dataset Overview

The database contains the following tables:

- `users`: Basic user profile info
- `wallets`: User wallet balances and open dates
- `transactions`: Wallet transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers)
- `loans`: Loan details, status, repayment, and amounts
- `kyc_documents`: Know-Your-Customer verification status

Sample data includes over 50 mock users and 1,000+ records across all tables.

## 📊 SQL Insights & Use Cases

📌 Here are key business questions answered using SQL:

- What % of users are verified via KYC?  
- Who are the top 5 users by transaction volume?  
- How do wallet balances change month over month?  
- What's the loan approval vs. rejection rate?  
- Which users are at risk of churn due to inactivity?

👉 Check `queries/analysis_queries.sql` for the actual SQL used.


## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **SQL** (MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible)
- **VSCode** for SQL editing
